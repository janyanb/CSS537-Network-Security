# Packet Sniffing and Spoofing

## Overview
This repository contains C programs developed to explore and implement packet sniffing and spoofing techniques. The implementations use libraries like pcap for packet sniffing and raw sockets for packet spoofing. In addition, the repository also includes a simple stateless firewall implementation using C programming, leveraging Netfilter modules and Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) in a Linux environment. The firewall is designed to filter incoming and outgoing packets based on specific criteria such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
